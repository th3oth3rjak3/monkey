# The Monkey Programming Language

This is an implementation of the Monkey Programming Language specification using the Go programming language.
Many thanks to Thorsten Ball for his excellent works "Writing an interpreter in Go" and "Writing a compiler in Go".

This project will contain two implementations, the first of which is a tree-walking interpreter, and the second of which is a bytecode virtual machine.
